### Javascript Hex Convertor

---
Hex/rgb CSS Colour Picker

Recreate a Javascript colour picker (http://colourco.de/ or similar)

When the user "selects" a colour, update the form to display their colour in both hex and rgba() formats. You will need to write a hex to rgb() converter function in Javascript. Avoid the standard libraries: try to figure out how to do this manually.

Bonus: display the colour in hsla() format.
