# Array and Hash access

### A. Given the following data structure:

```ruby
a = ["Anil", "Erik", "Jonathan"]
```

1. How would you return the string `"Erik"`?
1. How would you add your name to the array?

### B. Given the following data structure:

```ruby
h = {0 => "Zero", 1 => "One", :two => "Two", "two" => 2}
```

1. How would you return the string `"One"`?
1. How would you return the string `"Two"`?
1. How would you return the number `2`?
1. How would you add `{3 => "Three"}` to the hash?
1. How would you add `{:four => 4}` to the hash?

### C. Given the following data structure:

```ruby
is = {true => "It's true!", false => "It's false"}
```

1. What is the return value of `is[2 + 2 == 4]`?
1. What is the return value of `is["Erik" == "Jonathan"]`?
1. What is the return value of `is[9 > 10]`?
1. What is the return value of `is[0]`?
1. What is the return value of `is["Erik"]`?

### D. Given the following data structure:

```ruby
users = {
  "Jonathan" => {
    :twitter => "tronathan",
    :favorite_numbers => [12, 42, 75],
  },
  "Erik" => {
    :twitter => "sferik",
    :favorite_numbers => [8, 12, 24],
  },
  "Anil" => {
    :twitter => "bridgpal",
    :favorite_numbers => [12, 14, 85],
  },
}
```

1. How would you access Jonathan's Twitter handle (i.e. the string `"tronathan"`)?
1. How would you add the number `7` to Erik's favorite numbers?
