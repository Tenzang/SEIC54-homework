<!-- # Lab: Famous computer scientists fansite

## Research one (or more) of the following:

- Margaret Hamilton

## Requirements
- At least 3 pages (example: biography, trivia, hometown)
- At least 1 Google Font
- Whatever HTML and CSS you desire
- Keep your code clean and DRY
- Start working with semantic elements: http://html5doctor.com/lets-talk-about-semantics/
- No Javascript! Even if you know how to use jQuery, see how far you can push this with pure HTML + CSS
- Don't worry about responsiveness -- desktop resolution is fine

## Your research should aim to reveal at least two things about each person:
- Why Joel admires them
- Something Joel doesn't already know about them

## Optional extras
- Experiment with http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
- Record and embed a short podcast or vlog about your favourite scientist
- Try embedding other media (YouTube or Vimeo video, Soundcloud)
- Try embedding a Google map (for their hometown and/or alma mater) -->
