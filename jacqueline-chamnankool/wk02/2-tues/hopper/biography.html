                        <p>Grace Brewster Murray Hopper (née Murray; December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992) was an American
                            computer scientist and United States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the
                            Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the
                            first linkers. Hopper was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming
                            languages, and the FLOW-MATIC programming language she created using this theory was later
                            extended to create COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.</p>

                        <p>Prior to joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University and was
                            a professor of mathematics at Vassar College. Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during
                            World War II but was rejected because she was 34 years old. She instead joined the Navy
                            Reserves. Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I
                            team led by Howard H. Aiken.</p>

                        <p>In 1949, she joined the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the team that
                            developed the UNIVAC I computer. At Eckert–Mauchly she managed the development of one of the
                            first COBOL compilers. She believed that a programming language based on English was
                            possible. Her compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by computers. By
                            1952, Hopper had finished her program linker (originally called a compiler), which was
                            written for the A-0 System. During her wartime service, she co-authored three papers based
                            on her work on the Harvard Mark 1.</p>
